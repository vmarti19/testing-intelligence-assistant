goal: Verify feature activates or deactivates to input conditions that include a never received state
author: jochoa5
type: Functional
feature: Indicators
function: Generic

start:
    - Normal operation
sequence: |-
    1. Loop for each never received condition of the icon
        1. > Set random valid ignition status
        1. > Enable indicator randomly
        1. > Set indicator to any status different from expected at never received
        1. > Set indicator to never received state
        1. âœ“ Verify indicator in active or inactive state as per requirements
        1. > Disable indicator randomly
